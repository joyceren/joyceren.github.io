# Taking back control of your news:

Are you unhappy with your online newsstands recommendations?

Do you feel like your online newsstands are encouraging your bad habits by continuously showing you click bait?

Do you want to check your biases and have a better awareness of the news you're not being exposed to?

Are you getting bummed out by politics and just want to switch to happy news for a while but then switch back eventually?

Well have I got the app for you!

Hi! I'm Joyce and I made this because I was getting depressed about all the stupid Trump news that I was getting and I wanted to just read celebrity gossip about Selena Gomez getting back with Justin Beiber until I recovered.

Unfortunately, this made my entire newsfeed consist of stupid shit, and _the algorithm_ completely cut me off from the entire world of politics.

This made me realize just how much control _the algorithm_ had on what I see, and I started wondering what else was being filtered out of my news without my knowledge. (Kind of a hot button issue nowadays.) This doesn't mean I always want to read it, but it's good to know what's beyond your blinders.

It's kind of a pain in the ass to have to filter through the internet without the help of a computer brain, but it's better for our minds and our perspectives in the long run, I promise! Just like exercising and eating vegetables.

So eat your vegetables, folks, and exercise your brain a bit!
